## R Markdown {.unnumbered}

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Important commands when using RMarkdown: Use the `/` to quick insert markdown elements: R code chunk, Heading/Format Options, etc.

In-line code notation: \` \<- symbol with \~ on keyboard?

## Let's move onto R Basics!

## Comments

It is recommended to always comment/annotate your code to make concepts clear. In R, we use the `#` symbol to indicate a comment.

```{r class.output="bg-warning"}
# this is a comment 

#' 
#' this is a multi-line comment
#' 
```

## Using R as a calculator

```{r calculator}
# in either a script or the console, you can use it to solve basic arithmentic
1 / 200 * 30
sin(pi/2)
```

## R Packages

The `base` installation of R consists of many in-house `functions` and `commands`, but more specialized techniques would require the installation of packages. A few packages that you should have for this course and I would recommend downloading are:

-   `ggplot2`

-   `MASS`

-   `stats`

-   `tidyverse`/`dplyr`

*Note:* If you are using a mac, some development packages would require you to install `XQuartz` or `XCode`. If issues come up with installing a package or getting a package to work, please let me know so I can help you out!

Find more packages here: <https://cran.r-project.org/>

```{r installing_packages, eval=FALSE}
# how to install packages
install.packages("MASS")
```

```{r source_package}
# calling the package after installation
library("MASS")
```

```{r update_package, eval=FALSE}
# updating packages/all packages
update.packages()
```

## Directories

When you run RStudio, your session is typically associated with a *working directory.* This is the default location where your files are imported or saved.

```{r}
# check your working directory with this function
getwd()
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("/insertFilePathHere")
```

## Variables

You can save and create new objects to store your results by using `<-` (as opposed to the conventional `=` which is used with `named function assignments`.)

```{r storing_object}

# store the result of 4*3 into x

x <- 4 * 3

# print x (assignment alone does not print output)
print(x)
```

Note: R is a *dynamic language*, so the types and values can easily be changed. (type checks are done during run-time)

```{r change_type}
# x is now a of type character
x <- "statistics"
```

## R data types

A **data type** describes the kind of values a variable can hold and how R will interpret and use those values in calculations, comparisons, and functions. Choosing/creating the right data type is important because it affects how R stores information and what operations you can perform.

R data types include:

-   **`numeric`**:

    -   `double` values with decimals

    -   `int` whole numbers

-   **`character`** – text or strings (`"Hello"`)

-   **`logical`** – TRUE/FALSE values

-   **`factor`** – categorical data (`"A"`, `"B"`)

Use the `class()` function to determine what data type your variable is:

```{r check_class}
class(2L)
class(2)
```

## Data Vectors

An **R data vector** is a collection of observations or measurements concerning a single variable **of the same data type** (all numeric, all character, all logical, etc.). The `c()` function takes individual values and *combines them into a single vector*.

::: callout-example
In 2021, the average temperature in Guam for each month was 80.7, 81.4, 81.5, 82.6, 82.6, 83.7, 83.4, 81.8, 82.5, 81.4, 82.0, and 81.0. Store these values in a vector named `temp`.

*Solution:*

```{r storing_vector}
temp <- c(80.7, 81.4, 81.5, 82.6, 82.6, 83.7, 83.4, 81.8, 82.5, 81.4, 82.0, 81.0)

```
:::

```{r length_vector}
# returns the length of temp 
length(temp)
```

```{r sum_vector}
# we can perform these function because all values in temp is a numeric value
sum(temp)
```

```{r avg_vector}
mean(temp)
```

In the case you have a `NA` in your vector, `sum()` and `mean()` will return `NA`. To bypass that, you need to include the argument: `na.rm = TRUE`.

### Attributes

Vectors can be assigned **attributes** or **names.**

```{r assigning_vect_names}
months <- c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "July",
    "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")

names(temp) <- months
print(temp)
```

### Indexing

You can call a specific value in the `temp` vector by referencing its respective name.

```{r indexing_name}
# get the average temperature in May
temp["May"]
```

OR, you can index the vector by referencing its numeric index value.

```{r indexing_val}

# grabs the first value
temp[1]

# grab the first 4 values
temp[1:4]
```

### Operators

**Operators** are symbols that tell R what kind of computation to perform on values or variables. They are the building blocks for calculations, comparisons, and logical expressions.

#### Comparison:

-   `>` greater than
-   `<` less than
-   `<=` less than or equal to
-   `>=` greater than or equal to
-   `==` equal to
-   `!=` not equal to

::: callout-example
What months have a higher average temperature compared to August?

*Solution:*

```{r}
temp[temp < temp["Aug"]]
```
:::

Let's break the line of code down:

-   `temp['Aug']` : refers to the temperature in August.

-   `temp > temp['Aug']` : checks all values of the `temp` vector to check if this statement is true

-   `temp[temp > temp['Aug']]`: returns only the months & values where the second bullet is true.

#### Logical

-   `&` AND
-   `|` OR
-   `!` NOT

::: callout-example
### Using or operator:

What FALL months have a higher average temperature than August?

*Solution:*

```{r or_operator_example}
# let's define a vector that contains the fall months 

fall <- c("Sep", "Oct", "Nov")
temp[temp > temp["Aug"] | names(temp) %in% fall]
```
:::

-   `names(temp)` : calls the attributes of the `temp` vector

-   `%in%` : a special operator that checks if elements exist in a vector

-   `names(temp) %in% fall` : checks which attributes are in the `fall` vector

::: callout-example
### Using equals operator:

What month had the highest average temperature?

*Solution:*

```{r equals_op}
temp[temp == max(temp)]
```

OR if we want just the name of the month, we can index the value from the names attribute:

```{r equals_op_two}
names(temp)[temp == max(temp)]
```
:::

::: callout-example
What is the average temperature in the summer months?

*Solution:*

```{r}
temp[c("Jun", "July", "Aug")]

summer_months <- c("Jun", "July", "Aug")
summer_temps <- temp[summer_months]

average_summer <- mean(summer_temps)
print(average_summer)

```
:::

## Vector Operations

With vectors, you can utilize element-wise basic arithmetic.

For example, if we want to add 2 degrees to every temperature in the `temp` data vector, then we can define that as:

```{r add_vector}
temp <- temp + 2
```

::: callout-example
### Vector Operation

Convert all temperatures in our `temp` vector from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

We are going to apply this formula:

$$
C = \frac{5}{9}*(t - 32)
$$

to all values in our `temp` vector.

*Solution:*

```{r convert_vector}
temp_celcius <- (5/9) * (temp - 32)
```

All attributes are retained and all values are converted.
:::

```         
Example: 

Convert all temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celciu
```

## Sequences and Repetition

`R` has in-house functions that allow you to create a sequence of values (or repeat).

We will be using `seq` and `rep`, and you can read up for help on the documentation by using ?function in R. This pulls up the documentation and example usage

### Sequence

Without a function, the easiest way to create a sequence with intervals of 1 is using the colon operator

```{r}
print(1:10)
```

For more flexible sequences, we can use the `seq` function:

::: callout-example
### Sequence List

Create a list of every 3rd value from `1` to `20`

```{r seq}
seq(from = 1, to = 20, by = 3)
```

Note: This will *always* include the `from` value, but NOT the `to` value. This is dependent on the `by` number.
:::

Instead of specifying a `by` number, you can specify how many numbers you would like in between with `length.out` - this would be equally spaced.

```{r}
seq(from = 1, to = 10, length.out = 20)
```

For decreasing, set `` `by` `` to be a negative value and switch the `from` and `to` values.

```{r}
seq(from = 10, to = 1, by = -3)
```

## Random Sampling

The [`sample()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/sample.html) function takes a sample from the specified elements of `x` with or without replacement.

::: callout-example
### Creating a sample

Create a random sample of `20` values ranging from `1` to `100` with replacement.

```{r sample_ex}
sample(1:100, 20, replace = T)
```
:::

Note: running the above code again will not give you the same output:

```{r}
sample(1:100, 20, replace = T)
```

If you would like to replicate the same results every time, we have to set a seed by using the `set.seed(x)` function, where `x` is any arbitrary number.

```{r}
set.seed(415)
sample(1:100, 20, replace = T)
```

### Repetition

To repeat values in a vector, use the `rep()` function.

```{r rep_ex_1}
# repeat 1 four times 
rep(x = 1, times = 4)

# repeat 1 to 5, 10 times
rep(1:5, times = 10)

# repeat 1, 2, 5, 7 each values twice
rep(x = c(1, 2, 5, 7), times = 3, each = 2)

# repeat each element in x by specified vector time (1
# once, 2 four times, 5, once, and 7 twice)
rep(x = c(1, 2, 5, 7), times = c(1, 4, 1, 2))

```
